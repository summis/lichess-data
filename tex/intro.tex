\section{Introduction}

In this report I analyze what factors are related to good performance i.e. high winning probability in chess games against stronger opponents. My data set consists of chess games that author of this report has played between 2016-2021 on website lichess.org under username aitotumainen against other human players around the world.

In section \ref{sec:univariate} I introduce variables in the data and build understanding of the data through visualizations. In section \ref{sec:bivariate} I perform bivariate correspondence analysis on the data. In section \ref{sec:multivariate} I use multiple correspondence analysis to gain more insight about performance in chess games. Finally in section \ref{sec:conclusions} I summarize results, discuss about their limitations and propose ideas for further research.
