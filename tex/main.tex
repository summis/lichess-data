% Maximum points are 6 and the 6 points are divided as follows.

% Intro (description of the research question and of the data source or data collection) --- max 0.5 p.
\include{intro.tex}

% Univariate analysis (description of the variables, summary statistics, visualization) --- max 1p.
\include{univariate.tex}

% Bivariate analysis (analysis of bivariate dependencies, visualization) --- max 1 p.
\include{bivariate.tex}

% Multivariate analysis --- max 3 p. This is divided to selection of the method --- max 1 p.; technical implementation --- max 1 p.; and presenting the results/interpretation --- max 1 p.

% Just because why not
% \include{probability.tex}
% actually just not.

% Critical evaluations (report about possible sources of biases etc.) --- max 0.5 p.
\include{conclusions.tex}

% If the report is not polished (blurry images, text in the marginal etc), that may lead to -1p.
