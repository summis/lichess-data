# lichess-data

Data analysis project for course MS-E2112 - Multivariate Statistical Analysis. I analyze what factors are related to good performance against stronger opponents in my chess games that I have played on lichess.org. Analysis is based on data visualizations and bivariate and multiple correspondence analysis. Python and R are used for analysis and results are summarized in pdf report.
